A simple Hartreeâ€“Fock program with MP2 and CCSD extension. 

This program is written to learn a bit about quantum chemistry and fortran programming. Until now I stick at most to the crawdad programming project (link below). I share my first program in the hope that it helps someone when starting either with fortran or quantum chemistry.

CCSD code is under development and currently not working.
